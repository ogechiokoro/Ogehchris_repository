He also advised us to be good ambassador to our family institution and the world at large.  We were meant to understand the stages of opportunity identification process. Opportunity is the collection of three main factors, which are the entrepreneur’s background, the business influence and the general business environment. Opportunity identification has five stages that lead the recognition. The five stages are discussed in relationship with the process identification. These stages are preparation, incubation, insight, evaluation, and Elaboration.

•	Creativity</p>
<br/>Another unique section was mentioned which makes every student to pay a must concentration. We were so astonished to hear about this concept of business growth and poverty reduction all over the world, added that this is because the social and economic value added through innovation and employment generation is critical to increase in the overall productiveness of the economy, that the more entrepreneur produces, the more the input in form of raw material, labour, and other supplies are required, thus this is essential for business to grow in other to serve the interest of the owner and also contribute positively to the economy development of that region and nation, advising us we should not wait for government, and that the government in many developing countries including Nigeria, have not done well in providing, enabling environment for business to flourish.
       <hr/>However, the ultimate responsibilities for growing business rest on the shoulder of the owner and management, Business growth means expanding firms product and services or expanding its objective market or some combination of cash, any increase the volume of activities of enterprises is a clear indication of growth, an entrepreneur may also capitalize on change of environment to expand his operation in other to exploits new opportunity theoretically. It has been shown that and known that behavioural threats are significantly influence to entrepreneur desire to grow his or her business
<h3><a name="strt"></a>STRATEGIES FOR BUSSINESS GROWTH</h3>
 He mentioned the opportunities in SWOT analysis. Some opportunities are sometime identified while the entrepreneur is having his or her self assessment in terms of strength, weakness, opportunities, and threats universally referred to SWOT. SWOT analysis is a useful self appraisal system for your strength and weaknesses that help establish your business or develop your business, by exploiting your ability, talent and opportunities. It is frequently used to understand, underline, and identified the opportunities open to you and the threats you are likely to encounter. SWOT analysis could also be that initial self appraisal of the ability of the business opportunity to start and survive. Business organization must grow in other to remain relevant and competitive. A firm is constantly search for and make use of knowledge og exchanging market in other to identified and exploits growth opportunities. Business term to grow in other to deliver their product or service better than competitors. But, the capacity of the firm to deliver resides in then range and quality product or services offered to the customer, the skill, and service offered by the staff, technical knowledge/technology and customer/supplier relationships.
        Therefore, entrepreneurs are expected to create an environment that will fit the growtn agenda of the firm. This entails continuous assessment of structures, policies, procedures, system activities, decision making, and coordination and communication network. All of these factors are vital to achieving optimum growth .when a firm is better organized, they are a number of alternative parts for growth. They include:
•	Expanding [product line or service offering
•	Opening new branches/division
•	Exporting
•	Innovation
•	Creating and maintaining online presence
•	Franchising and licensing
<p>The managing director was quoted by saying that the key to creating and victorious operation in new location is to ensure that a demand already existed or the company is capable of stimulating demand in the new market, talking about innovation he stated that it’s the greatest sources of sustained growth observing this he added that innovative companies are skilful at a continually responding to overcome new competitive or other environment challenges, He said that innovation  can be signified continuous in the way your company serves it customers of conduct in business, this suggest that constant growth flows on ideas that reinvent work process, a business is condemned. He also said that many businesses in Africa is informal or family operated, saying that to be successful that there is need for a shift towards modernization and employing a global good practices for managing ventures sticking to tradition methods of operating weather a company, shop or factory no longer work. We were told that entrepreneurs are required to drive change processes that will create unique value by tapping in to the creative talent of members of the organization, he was quick to mention some firms like Nokia mobile phone company and Sony Ericson which has continually alter and improve. Their product features to create new value thereby retaining existing customers worldwide, advising  us to be creating and maintaining online presence he also ask us to supply (SWOT) analysis in the system of our business that this could help us identify so many factors in our business such as strength, weakness, opportunity and threats to any business.
We were also meant to understand that as employment are generated, the increase in productivity raises, the level of wealth creation in a given economic environment, this is why the productiveness of an economy is related to increasing and improving the standard of living, so as activities of enterprise increase in laboured productivity and efficient use of resources, all things being equal lead to good wages in individual worker, more profit for the company and rise in GDP for the nation, when production is higher cost of production tends to be lower cost of production. Citizens obtain production cheaper and this in turn increases the living standard of the individual people. Hence there are two types of business growth which include external growth and internal growth, the main obstacle is that its takes time or may exceed, let go back to SWOT analysis which creates dynamic in underlying business and some opportunities are some time under listed while the enterprise is having his or her self assessment in terms of strength and weaknesses. As earlier said SWOT analysis is a useful self appraisal systematic to strengthen weaknesses that helps establish your business or develop your business.</p>
